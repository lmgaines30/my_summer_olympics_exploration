    "## The prominance of the United States and China \n",
    "\n",
    "From childhood, I was fascinated with the Olympics.  Every 4 years, I loved to watch as much of the Summer Olympics as I could.  From Gymnastics, to diving and swimming, I could not get enough.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, I must admit I hadn't really paid attention to the Olympics since 1996, when they were held in Atlanta. That all changed this year with the Paris 2024 Olympics.  My childhood delight in the Olympics was back with a passion.  The United States is having a bit of a renaissance with Women's sports. Let's call it the Caitlyn Clark effect for the Women's Basketball & the WNBA. For Gymnastics, it marked the return of Simone Biles. Having withdrawn from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, would she be able to cement her GOAT status in Women's Gymnastics?  In Track and Field, would Sha'Carri Richardson finally claim the gold medal in the 100 meters race after being deemed ineligible to compete in 2020?  \n",
    "\n",
    "I tuned in for every Gynmastics event, Women's Basketball, Track & Field,  even \"Breaking\". As the battle for medals continued this year, it seemed like a tug of war between the US and China for the leaderboard in number of medals won.  Ultimately, it ended with the USA in first place with the most gold medals, and a tie with China for the total overall medals. \n",
    "\n",
    "This made we wonder, has the USA always dominated the summer games? Or is it just my pride for my country that's creating a biased view for me.  When I was a kid, it was always a battle between the US and Russia?  Is China the new competition for the USA when it comes to medal count?  I decided to dig into the historical medal counts and find out."
